8 Hours

Learning about SwiftUI

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Test development can improve, mainly covering API error scenarios

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
It was a surprise to learn that CC was in the SwiftUI language, I confess that I didn't have many opportunities to develop in this language, where until then I had little contact. I saw a great opportunity in this test to learn better, and see its advantages and disadvantages

I should start this project as an initial step for my personal projects to learn better about the language
